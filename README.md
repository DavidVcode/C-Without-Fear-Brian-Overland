# C-Without-Fear-Brian-Overland
Academic exercises and Notes from C++ Without Fear by Brian Overland

This repository is a collection of academic exercises and personal notes from Brian Overlands's books.

The purpose of these exercises are fundamental improvment and understanding the C++ language and programming from a layman's starting point. It is my aim that a slow and gradual accumulation of projects will show a definitive roadmap of progress or, through painpoints, lack of clarity, careful documentation of challenges presented, and my attempted solutions.

Some problems may go unresolved if the resources available to me are insufficient to overcome a particular exercise within a reasonable timeframe. In this event, I will try to label the individual project as "PROBLEMATIC" or "UNRESOVLED".

Observers are welcome to add tips or remarks to help expedite the learning process.
